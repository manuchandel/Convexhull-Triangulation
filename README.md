# Convexhull - Triangulation

* This repository contains my computational geometry project.
* I did this project as a part of computational geometry course in 4th year.

## Problem Statement

Solve the problem of finding the convex hull and triangulating that using the algorithm for triangulating
monotone partitions considering the following instructions:
1. Your program should take ‘n’ as input (e.g., 20) from the user, then randomly generates ‘n’ distinct points with X and Y coordinates in 2D geometry.
2. Draw the convex hull of these set of points using Quick Hull method.
3. Now assume the convex hull as the given monotone polygon. Triangulate this monotone polygon using line sweep algorithm.

## Installation

* For demo purposes just download the Application.jar file and run it on any machine with java pre-installed. For linux based systems change the permission of the file to executable.
* For development purposes import project folder using eclipse.
* MD5 checksum of file is ...
